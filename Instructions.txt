These are the instructons to use the GyroRead4 application.

The application records and shows gyroscope data from all three axes at a suggested 20 Hz sampling rate.

After starting the application you can press the `start/stop' button to indefinitly record data.
While the application is running you can press the `start/stop' button again to stop the recording.

To record for a specific amount of time, press the input bar at the bottom which brings up a menu to input a number.
Here you can input the amount of seconds you would like to record. Then you can press `start/stop' to start the recording, and it will automatically stop after the amount of seconds you set.
Setting 0 will make the application record indefinitly.

To save a recording, press the `save' button. This will save the recording, and show the location and name of the saved file on the top of the screen.
The name will consist of the date and time when saving. This file can be collected from the phone after connecting to a linux pc using the `abd pull' command.

To start a second recording, first press the `clear' button at the bottom of the screen. This will delete the data present so that the data will be only from the new recording.
This does, however, not clear the graphs you see on the screen.
